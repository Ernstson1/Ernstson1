## Hi, my name is Isac
I'm a software technology student exploring systems programming, backend development, and data-related projects.
I learn primarily by building small projects and increasing complexity over time.  


### Interests & Direction
- Systems programming and understanding how software works under the hood  
- Backend development and databases  
- Data analysis and early machine learning exploration  


### Tech Stack
I mainly work in C at the moment, exploring low-level programming and system concepts through personal projects.
I also use Java occasionally, Python for scripting and data-related tasks, and work comfortably with Git in my projects.

### Projects
My projects are personal and learning-focused.
I use them to explore new concepts, test ideas, and improve my understanding by building things from scratch.
The focus is on fundamentals rather than polished end products.  

### Selected Projects
- [Simple Falling Sand Game in C](link coming soon)  
  A simple falling sand game built using C and SDL2 to explore graphics, input handling, and basic physics simulation.
