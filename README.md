## Hi, my name is Isac
I'm a software technology student exploring systems programming, backend development, and data-related projects.
I learn primarily by building small projects and increasing complexity over time.  


### Interests & Direction
- Systems programming and understanding how software works under the hood  
- Backend development and databases  
- Data analysis and early machine learning exploration  


### Tech Stack
I mainly work in C at the moment, exploring low-level programming and system concepts through personal projects.
I also use Java occasionally, Python for scripting and data-related tasks, and work comfortably with Git in my projects.

### Projects
My projects are personal and learning-focused.
I use them to explore new concepts, test ideas, and improve my understanding by building things from scratch.
The focus is on fundamentals rather than polished end products.  

### Selected Projects
- [Simple Falling Sand Game in C](https://github.com/Ernstson1/Falling-Sand-Simulation)  
  A simple falling sand game built using C and SDL2.  
  It explores graphics rendering, mouse input handling, and basic physics simulation for falling sand grains.

- [Real-Time TCP Server](https://github.com/Ernstson1/RealTimeServer)  
  A personal project implementing a real-time communication server in Java.  
  It supports multiple TCP clients, custom packet handling, chat rooms, and message broadcasting.  
  Designed with a non-blocking NIO architecture and separation of concerns for easy expansion.
